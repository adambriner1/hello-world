Entering the unknown (for a plebby westerns-style scientist)
Well good grief, here we go. I have needed to get my ass into gear with this shit for a while now, and putting it off any longer would really be a serious fuckup. Thanks coursera, even though you're a fucking price gouge I'm very thankful for the help. Love ya.
